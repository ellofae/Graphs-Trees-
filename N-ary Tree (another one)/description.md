<h3>Longest path (paths) of a N-ary Tree</h3>
This algorithm for a N-ary Tree prints out longest path (paths) of a whole tree from leafs to leafs, roots to roots.

The algorithm generates a file "values.txt" with values for roots of a Binary Tree.
The algorithm creates an N-ary Tree and parses values from a "values.txt" file into roots of a tree, so creating a N-ary Tree.
The algorithm performs iteration through the whole N-ary Tree, finds longest paths in decresing order, increasing order and then combines them to make full paths.
The algorithm prints out the longest paths of a tree.
