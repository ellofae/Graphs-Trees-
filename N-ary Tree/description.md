<h3>Longest path (paths) where value of each root is an odd number in an N-ary Tree</h3>

1. The algorithm generates a file "values.txt" with values for roots of an N-ary Tree.
2. The algorithm creates an N-ary tree and parses values from a "values.txt" file into roots of a tree, so creating a binary tree.
3. The algorithm performs iteration through the whole N-ary Tree, finds longest paths whose roots' values are odd numbers and prints them out.
