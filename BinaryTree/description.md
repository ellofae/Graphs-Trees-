<h3>Longest path (paths) of a Binary Tree</h3>

This algorithm for a Binary Tree prints out longest path (paths) of a whole tree from leafs to leafs, roots to roots.

1) The algorithm generates a file "values.txt" with values for roots of a Binary Tree.
2) The algorithm creates a binary tree and parses values from a "values.txt" file into roots of a tree, so creating a binary tree.
3) The algorithm performs iteration through the whole Binary Tree, finds longest paths in decresing order, increasing order 
   and then combines them to make full paths.
4) The algorithm prints out the longest paths of a tree.
